Statement of Bayes’ theorem
Bayes’ theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic
events A and B:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A)
P(B) .
Each term in Bayes’ theorem has a conventional name:
• P(A) is the prior probability or marginal probability of A. It is ”prior” in
the sense that it does not take into account any information about B.
• P(A|B) is the conditional probability of A, given B. It is also called the
posterior probability because it is derived from or depends upon the spec-
ified value of B.
• P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A.
• P(B) is the prior or marginal probability of B, and acts as a normalizing constant
